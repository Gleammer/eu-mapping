Asociația Culturală Metropolis;Str. Constantin F. Robescu, nr. 1 bis, sect. 3, Bucharest, ROMANIA;NGO;http://www.balkanikfestival.ro/;Cinema, Music;Festival;"Asociația Culturală Metropolis is an NGO association founded by Daniel Mitulescu in 2011 in Bucharest. The cultural profile coupled to Asociația Culturală Metropolis is quality audio-visual and film productions presenting high quality national and international (European) films, world music from the midd le east and Balkan. The association is involved in a large range of activities in the field of the festivals - cinema, media literacy, cultural heritage, music, craftsmanship, and visual art and film distribution. These activities are in accordance with the main aims of the Association in terms of Audience Development.<br/>Balkanik Festival is a socio-cultural project, aiming at creating a bridge of understanding between the country’s minorities and encouraging cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue. It is an international multicultural and multidisciplinary festival (artists from other countries, media partners with international coverage, partnerships with similar festivals from all Europe, collaboration with embassies and foreign cultural institutes) addressed to national and international audiences. The festival gives spaces to several ethnic groups from the Balkans, but also artist groups from countries like France, Belgium, Germany, Syria, Iran, India, Canada etc. The festival has a multidisciplinary program schedule that includes music, arts crafts fair, dance, painting, sculpture, photography, circus shows, culinary art etc.";"Asociația Culturală Metropolis has explored new strategies for AD and it can be seen as an audience-centric organization: indeed AD vision and projects are part of the general strategic plan. Asociația Culturală Metropolis’ AD approach emerged from the first artistic project and was conceived with the perspective of building long lasting relationships with diversified audiences. Asociația Culturală Metropolis’ approach to AD is not project based, but more process oriented and holistic. The organic model means that AD is integrated to the overall work organization and activities. Daniel Mitulesco, the director, Ligia Kesisian-Mitulescu, the artistic director, and the PR responsible, develops the Ad strategy.<br/>Balkanik Festival is addressed to a more general public and attracts all age groups providing activities for them. However, a large number of its spectators are young (2540), with high levels of education and moderate to high income, living in urban areas, coming from Romania or abroad (mostly Western Europe).<br/>AD goals aims at: <br/>- Deepening the relationship with the audience (audience by choice), using Internet and social media channels actively, organizing competitions for winning invitations to the festival, teaser events before the festival, workshops for different age groups within the fair, working with volunteers.<br/>- Enlarging the audience through activities addressed to specific target audiences:<br/>Focus on children: organizing playgrounds and workshops within the arts and crafts fair,<br/>Focus on elder people: inviting unknown artists from rural areas in Romania, which are preferred by them, promoting the arts and crafts fair,<br/>Focus on minority groups: the arts and crafts fair and the concerts are inspired by their culture, organizations representing minorities receive invitations to the festival.";"Asociația Culturală Metropolis aims also at having an impact on mentalities in Romanian society, promoting European values such as tolerance, non-discrimination, celebration of diversity and multiculturalism, respect and appreciation for minorities. <br/>Asociația Culturală Metropolis is raising sensitivity for film, in a close dialogue with audiences, due to an integrated programming and mediation, a supply-balancing put of a cultural policy and film culture. <br/>In terms of impact Balkanik festival aims at increasing the general public’s knowledge of the cultural traditions of the Balkans and of minorities in Romania, increasing the levels of tolerance and social inclusion (especially of the Roma community), ensuring and increasing the access to diverse and good quality contemporary art by inviting around 150 artists each year and displaying diverse forms of artistic expression.";building capacity, by choice, by habit, by surprise, organisational change, place
Auditorio de Tenerife “Adán Martín”;Av de la Constitución, 1, 38003 Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Tenerife Island, Canary Islands, SPAIN;Public Company;www.auditoriodetenerife.com;Music;Concerts, Performances;The Auditorio de Tenerife, designed by the renowned architect Santiago Calatrava, is considered one of the most emblematic buildings of Spanish architecture. It is located in the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in an impressive site, next to the Atlantic Ocean and in front of the ancient Anaga Mountains. It opened on September 2003 and was conceived to become the home of the Tenerife Symphony Orchestra, the Canary Islands Music Festival and the Opera Festival, organised by that time by the local association of opera friends. Therefore, the building was equipped with a philharmonic hall (1658 seats), a chamber hall (428 seats) and some smaller areas, such as rehearsal and meeting rooms or dance and exhibition halls.;"The Auditorium has travelled abroad on a regular basis to obtain training or to get to know other case studies and best practices. From the outset they understood that audience analysis was crucial to implement a successful AD approach. Hence, a great emphasis has always been placed on the information systems.<br/>In 2004, when most of the theatres in Spain were still selling their tickets at the box office, the Auditorium already had a ticketing system running. In certain performances they even reached peaks of 72% of the tickets sold online. This enabled them to get a global picture of what was happening in terms of sales: the type of tickets sold and of the channels in which they were sold. For instance, once they observed that a lot of tickets were sold in shopping malls and afterwards they decided to create specific marketing campaigns in those venues.<br/>Considering the three types of audiences - by habit, by choice and by surprise – the Auditorio de Tenerife pursues all of them, but the strategy varies depending on the product. Sometimes the accent is on diversifying audiences, while in other cases it is put on widening or deepening audiences.";"Three factors have underpinned the AD approach in the Auditorio de Tenerife. Firstly, the Auditorium, as a public space, was guided by a public notion on culture and concepts like accessibility or inclusion were part of its DNA. Secondly, a very important element was the fact that the Council of Tenerife was also aligned with this approach and that it was a real support and not a stopper for the different projects in which the Auditorium decided to embark on. Finally, a crucial aspect was the team, the people who had the vision and took it further, working together in a flexible way and implicitly accepting an organic bottom-up change. <br/>The AD approach of the Auditorium emerged from the first artistic project and was conceived with the perspective of building long lasting relationships with a diversified audience. Programming, production and education were essential building blocks of the project. The marketing director, who had a background working in private companies outside the cultural sector, understood that the principles of cultural and general marketing were mainly the same. This dissonance between the different perspectives on AD has enriched the organisation as it has led to a constant tension that has triggered projects that probably would not have been born. The type of projects developed to persuade the marketing department of the artistic approach were small-scale initiatives with the aim of building long lasting relationships with certain segments of the audience and with the local community.";building capacity, by choice, by habit, by surprise, data, leadership, place
Brighton Early Music Festival;Ham Cottage, Albourne Road, Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex, UNITED KINGDOM;Company limited by guarantee / Registered charity;www.bremf.org.uk;Music, Performing Arts;Concerts, Education, Festival;"Brighton Early Music Festival (BREMF) was co-founded by artistic directors Clare Norburn and Deborah Roberts as a pilot project in 2002 in Brighton, East Sussex. To date it’s the largest early music festival (with a Brighton twist) in the South of England. The main activity of the charity is the festival, which takes place in late October and early November.<br/>The organisation’s objectives are:<br/>To encourage, advance, develop and maintain public education in appreciation of and involvement in pre-classical and classical music and the performing arts, by promoting periodically a series of public concerts, dramatic performances, exhibitions and other cultural events.<br/>To promote and assist in the advancement of public and professional education by the provision of workshops, lectures and educational events for people of all ages.";"Their AD strategy aims at broadening audiences, increasing numbers and diversifying audience experience: <br/>New audiences are vital for the growth and development of our organisation. <br/>1. Diversifying audiences: • A range of appealing and distinctive events, which challenge stereotypes about what, a classical concert can be – for example using cabaret format with atmospheric lighting “We challenge the idea of the audience sitting quietly in a row. (audience by choice/(audience by habit), • collaborating with different art forms such as theatre and dance (For example, in 2015 BREMF produced an Opera appealing to an audience of Opera goers but not necessarily of early music audience. As well as experimental collaboration with different art forms for example – aerial dancers.) (audience by habit), • taking events to new and unexpected spaces eg. pubs and clubs - Taking early music performers into existing open mic nights in Brighton pubs (audience by surprise), • working with their 16-30 User Group (audience members and young volunteers) to target younger audiences (Brighton has a large student population) (audience by choice). Ideas suggested by this group include their very successful £5 Prom tickets,<br/>2. Widening the audiences reaching out to audiences who are already attending cultural events but don’t regularly attend Brighton Early Music Festival. The BREMF Ambassadors AD group are key to this objective – they tap into their own networks to spread the word about the festival through word of mouth marketing. Initiatives spread by the BREMF Ambassadors led in increased penetration among family audiences, a preview article on Gscene and LGBT magazine, and scheme members bringing groups to the event (audience by habit).";"Their AD strategy is key to their development as an organization. The audience-centric approach is embedded in their mission and values. The Festival Producer Cathy Boyes, (a new role created in 2012) leads on AD work and this is a growing part of her responsibilities, overseen by Co-artistic Director Clare Norburn who has a strong background in AD and traditional marketing. Whereas the other director is very involved in building the music community in Brighton and she knows the barriers of accessing music. <br/>”Communicate your vision, we have a lot of volunteers and we talk to them a lot! Communicate with all our stakeholders.” <br/>“It informs our programme as well as our marketing.”<br/>What is interesting is that everybody in BREMF is focused on the audience goals outlined above. From the artistic directors to the volunteers they are keen to reach out to new audiences. The view of the artistic directors trickles down to the whole the organization. “Keep an open mind – open to new ideas and listen to everyone who is involved. Even though your immediate reaction is all this will not work!";by choice, by habit, by surprise, community rooted, data, organisational change, partnership, place
Bunker;Slomškova 7, SI - 1000 Ljubljana, SLOVENIA;Private institute, non-profit organization;www.bunker.si;Dance, Music, Performing Arts;Education, Festival, Networking, Performances, Research;Bunker is oriented to performing arts. It was established in 1997 as a private, non-profit institute in order to promote young performing artists through the Mladi Levi festival that was initiated in 1998. Since many other festivals have started to present emerging performing artists Bunker has expanded its commitment to performing arts through following areas: performing arts production, festivals, international cooperation through networks and collaboration projects, educational programs, discussion evenings and management of the venue located in the outskirts of Slovenia's capital city of Ljubljana. The venue is in an old power station converted into the performing arts centre. It is used by Bunker, but is also service/space for other performing arts organizations.;Owing to the legacy the organization has developed over the past 20 years, Bunker has its own regular audience, mainly “audience by habit” and related to Ljubljana's arts scene. But Bunker also targets different audiences, depending on the content of the program. The organisation initiated various programs (volunteer program, community projects, educational program) through which its audience base became more diverse, thus transitioning towards more audience-oriented organization. Enlarging and diversifying the audience are important for Bunker, but the main criteria for the organization is not following the logic of audience numbers but the quality of the arts and fostering meaningful relationships between artistic content and audience. In that sense, Bunker tries to create spaces for community where changes could develop. In order to provide more concrete impacts, Bunker provides space for laboratories in which explores new possible locations for AD. Deepening the relationship with the audience is done by personal contacts and discursive program while diversification is done through implementation of educational programs for young people or various participatory projects in local community. In that way Bunker has reached “audience by surprise”, people who come to see performances even they do not know what to expect and who usually do not attend Bunker's type of events. Using various methods, such as subtitles, kindergarten, free admissions, etc., Bunker also gathers “audience by choice”, people who are interested in specific themes, artists and events.;"Reflecting the need to find useful methods in approaching complexity that defines today's conditions in arts and culture, Bunker explores new strategies for AD and shifts towards the audience-centric organization. It is recognized as an organization that tries to involve artists and audiences in complex reflexive and critical dialogue. Working directly with different people and opening up various topics are extremely important for Bunker because in Slovenia, as Koprivšek stressed, “the media space for contemporary culture does not exist any more”. <br/>Bunker's approach to AD is not project based, but more process oriented and holistic. This organic model means that AD is integrated to the overall work of organization. As Bunker's organizational structure is horizontal, employees share responsibilities and each of them is in charge of content and budget of a certain project, Bunker's structure does not develop top-down approach to AD. Over the time, Bunker has changed the mode of work and starts to operate more trans-disciplinary (collaborates with urban planners, sociologists, educators, etc.), and participates in many different networks at the local, national or international level. When Bunker works in specific area, then it cooperates with experts, academics and researchers of particular field. To get more information on its audience, the organization conducts researches in the neighbourhood. Based on these data Bunker started few new projects. Bunker invested a lot of effort in organizing series of events to connect with local community and the most important result is the establishment of informal network of arts quarter Tabor that represents Bunker's neighbourhood and subsequently the space in which Bunker inscribes its work in order to improve the quality of life in this local district.";by choice, by habit, by surprise, community rooted, organisational change, partnership, place
CAOS - Centro Arti Opificio Siri;Viale Luigi Campofregoso, 98, 05100, Terni, ITALY;Temporary Consortium;www.caos.museum;Dance, Music, Performing Arts, Visual Arts;Concerts, Education, Exhibitions, Performances, Residency, Workshops;"In 2006 the first activity of Indisciplinarte was an international contemporary arts festival focused on performing arts in the town of Terni, a former industrial area in the centre of Italy, now completely dismissed and strongly marked by its industrial past. The festival has grown over years, and the initiative legitimised Indisciplinarte as a strong cultural player. <br/>First constituted as cultural association, Indisciplinarte became a private company and formed a consortium with other companies in a so-called “temporary association of enterprises”, to participate in a bid to manage the venue CAOS, a former industrial compound owned by the municipality. It was renovated and opened in 2009, in the centre of Terni. This marked a first step towards a different way of relating with the urban environment, since having a huge physical space pushed the company to find different ways of engaging with the local community. <br/>With over 5000m2 at its disposal, CAOS is a complex centre of art production, hosting two museums, one exhibition area, one theatre, a residency centre, a library, a café-restaurant, a cinema and a special area for educational activities with about 1100 activities annual. CAOS has established strong relationships with different partners operating locally, nationally and internationally: universities, associations, schools, cultural institutions (museums, libraries, etc.), theatre companies and venues, networks.";"After 7 years, they are now able to reach about 70.000 people, while the city of Terni has a population of 120.000. When they started, they were ‘just’ a performing arts festival, running one main activity, intense and successful, but also concentrated in time and space. They didn’t have a single venue and they were unable not even to know how many people participated in the festival. They just had the feeling they had started something important. After two years, the event with a strong artistic vision linked to active participation, brought them onto the agenda of the municipality. This led to the city tender for a private management of the CAOS venue. CAOS at first was thought as just the new venue for two city museums (art and archaeology), but now it is a vital cultural centre offering much more than museum visits. <br/>Participation increased over time, despite continuously decreasing public funding, thanks to the huge diversification of the cultural offer. Cinema, a theatre season, exhibitions, educational activities linked to the museums, were progressively added to the festival, leading to the full schedule that CAOS has today, where citizens can find something appealing each day. <br/>This happened mostly through a trial and error approach, through an extensive building of relations with other cultural institutions and stakeholders, locally and regionally. This openness led them to partnering with an increasing number of players, enriching the cultural offer and the market penetration of CAOS.";"Having an impact on people has always been a focus for Indisciplinarte, questioning and revising themselves in their work. Self-reflective practices as well as project evaluation are somehow part of their DNA. In the first year, their artistic vision and audience mission dominated this reflective practice. The need to become more structured appeared later: they have been observing, interviewing, talking with people as a common and daily practice, but they didn’t use these materials to collect and analyse quantitative data, partly because it was outside their competences, partly because it was also outside their idea of what was needed. <br/>One simple practice they adopted was to give up the external service that was managing the info desk, and to decide that every and each member of the staff should periodically work at the desk, in order to gain a shared and clearer idea of community needs and requests.<br/>If their focused listening attitude (“we don’t know their profile, we know their names!”) has been effective, things are changing because they feel it’s not enough to tackle the challenge of sustainability. After the first phase of providing a festival and a second phase of venue management, they feel ready for the next challenge: to structure their audience knowledge in data, and to find a way “to go from audience engagement to AD”.";building capacity, by choice, by habit, by surprise, co-creation, partnership, place

It is initiated by the Culture Yard in Elsinore and realized through a complex collaboration with local and international partners, reaching out to an audience of 3.600 in 2016. CLICK reaches a segment with an interest in exploring the cross field between contemporary art, science and technology, those willing to get on board on a journey towards ‘undiscovered’ opportunities. <br/>The Culture Yard is a cross disciplinary and aesthetic institution aiming at a triangular vision based on three equally balanced elements: the artistic production, the social audience experience and the historical or architectural framework. Whether it is a performance, a concert, talks or art installations, these three elements form the very spine of the programming.";"The idea behind the festival is to embrace and explore new ‘territories’. The festival consists of performances, concerts, talks, exhibitions, workshops and what is described as the ‘Re-conquest of the Internet’. The program offers a variety of events, where the audience is invited to actively take part, to stay, to play and not least to connect to both digital and analogue activities. <br/>The vision behind CLICK is about the enforcement of cultural innovation. The vision is closely connected to Elsinore’s interregional strategy4 where people from culture, science, business and education strive to create new cultural improvements in the city. CLICK shall put Elsinore on the map as more than the site of Hamlet and give Denmark a new important platform of media art, wherefrom artists can improve, be exposed and create contacts in an international context.<br/>CLICK is an example of how the Culture Yard works with deepening the relationship with a defined target group. Through connecting to networks and subcultures engaged with biotech, bio art, gentech, collaborative media, artists, researchers and the like, CLICK has become a meeting space for an innovative, curious and engaged segment, who seem to expect to be invited to participate and engage during their visit at the festival. By creating an interface with their audience, allowing them to contribute themselves, they have managed to increase numbers over the years and they now see the more return visits to the festival.";"CLICK is the result of collaboration with research and educational institutions as well as with a variety of other cultural institutions throughout Denmark and being part of networks and partnerships in particular USA and Asia, focusing on both curatorial and collaborative productions. The festivals content is largely curated through a co-operation of Danish and foreign competences of artists, scientists, students and professionals working with larger and smaller unions, educational institutions and companies. These form a group, which members are elected by the administrators of the festival program, and holds a close dialogue to their respective networks in order to keep an open and investigative dialogue with an extended group of interested. <br/>CLICK has a clear audience-specific focus - an audience by choice. Its purpose is to build an open platform that attracts a curios audience and give them the opportunity to become familiar with the current and innovative trends in art. Additionally, the ambition is to establish an environment where local, national and international artists as well as professionals and relevant companies can cooperate, share knowledge, expand networks and stimulate ideas. CLICK invites the audience to create solutions and possible answers to some of our times most challenging bio-technological and societal challenges, giving back the opportunity for change to the visitors. <br/>In terms of AD, the main objectives the Culture Yard has achieved through CLICK is the establishment of a slowly growing community of curious visitors and enthusiasts from all over Denmark, who comes to Elsinore to engage and participate in the activities and share knowledge, networks and ideas. However, it is a challenge for the future to be able to attract audiences different from the current and audiences with no or limited previous contact with the festival. <br/>The main obstacles or challenges for CLICK lies in the ability make the translation into more accessible formats and thus reaching out for a broader audience.";by choice, by habit, co-creation, community rooted, digital, place

Since its foundation, CapoTrave has been recognized by the Tuscany Region among the most interesting young companies in the regional landscape, and therefore eligible for funding. The Visionari Project was created in 2007. From 2008 Kilowatt Festival has supported theatre, dance and performing arts productions. Since 2009 the festival has opened a contemporary music section, and the year after a visual arts section. In 2010, the Tuscany Region placed CapoTrave among the top 30 theatre companies supported by regional funding, in 2013 it was recognized as an Artists’ Residency by the Region and in 2015 also by Italian Ministry of Culture.";"The festival aims to share with the audience a decision-making role, providing spectators with responsibilities in a common space of creation, exploring new models and concepts of participation, accessibility, interaction, social cohesion and empowerment. <br/>Kilowatt’s AD strategy concerns the way a Performing Art Organization conceives and operates to engaging actively people. The ultimate goal of the organization is to improve understanding, fulfilment and growth of all the actors involved in the artistic experience. <br/>Overall, Kilowatt’s audience goals are:<br/>• Development of new audiences for the festival, with particular attention to whom are not familiar with contemporary creation (audience by choice and by surprise) • Building a local community engaged with the festival (audience by habit and by choice)<br/>• Enlarging the participation of young people (in particular under 25 – audience by surprise)<br/>• Increasing loyalty to the festival (frequency of attendance – audience by habit and by choice)<br/>• Achieving a deeper engagement and building up an aware and mature audience (audience by habit)<br/>• Finding new way of engaging actively with people in the creative process (the selection of the shows and/or the creation of a new performance)<br/>• Improving understanding, fulfilment and growth of all those involved in the artistic experience";"Kilowatt’s AD strategy is key to its development as an organisation. The audience-centric approach is embedded in the nature of the festival as it has been formed during the years, and now it is what makes Kilowatt unique. The audience-centric approach is an organizational praxis, all the staff is involved and aware of its importance. <br/>Thanks to the participation in the European Project and to the public funding related to the Residency activities, Kilowatt has developed a long-term AD strategy, with the ambition of sharing results with the entire performing arts sector. Sharing is done thanks to the research project BeSpectACTive and finalized to understand the effect of the participative approach on the organisations, the audiences, and the artists. <br/>With the exception of the European Project, Kilowatt has not implemented specific evaluation tools. They made an only one survey on the public of the festival in 2011, and now they have the direct qualitative feedback of the Visionari. They made systematic analysis of the insights for Facebook and analytics for the website. <br/>The steady development of activities forced an increase of the staff, involved in all the phases of the programming, but also to a more hierarchical approach: the head of the management is now supported by the two creators of the festival and all the member of the staff are working strictly close to them, sharing responsibility and goals.";by choice, by habit, by surprise, co-creation, community rooted, economic sustainability, leadership, organisational change
Maison des Métallos;94 rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud, Paris 11e, FRANCE;Public Establishment of Cultural Cooperation;www.maisondesmetallos.org;Cinema, Dance, Digital Arts, Music, Performing Arts, Visual Arts;Concerts, Performances, Residency;"The XIX century building that now hosts MdM was a former music instruments factory, and then became headquarters of the Union Fraternelle des Métallos, a situation that lasted for 60 years and that left an important legacy in terms of place identity. Since the Union left in 1997, the building was run by a committee of inhabitants of the neighbourhood, who occupied it because they felt it was part of local identity. They were concerned about the forthcoming gentrification, which was starting at that time in the former working class neighbourhood. This sense of belonging of the local community had an important role in pushing the municipality of Paris to buy the venue, but also created at first some tension with the occupants as the city decided to convert it in a cultural venue run by an appointed director, that opened in 2007. So the first audience “issue” that MdM had to face, was to find the way to involve and resolve this tension. The relationship with the associations and former occupants took time to be reconstructed, but it’s today an important part of the identity of MdM and of its relation with the neighbourhood.<br/>MdM employs today 33 people, while artistic workers are “intermittent”. MdM programs many activities: theatre shows, exhibitions, talks, debates, projections, workshops, residencies for hosted or co-productions, participatory workshops and activities with schools. It also runs a bar, an activity that doesn’t bring money itself, but it’s conceived as public service, so an essential part of being always open and welcoming for the community. Thus one the main issue for them is to communicate the overall identity and openness of the place, not just the copious amount of single activities, and an effort to connect people to the venue somehow independently from the programming.";"MdM has a wide range of artistic and cultural programming, and starting from their mission they address all kind of audiences, with a specific focus on accessibility as democracy issue, thus they work intensively on audience by surprise to diversify as much as possible, building strong relationships with groups and associations active in the social exclusion field. MdM aims to bring all kind of people to “feel at home”, and runs outreach activities also outside the building in the neighbourhood to reach groups and individuals in order to foster this sense of belonging and participation and bring them in. <br/>In the last three years the work with schools and groups has grown constantly, fostering both an increase of numbers of diverse audiences and a strengthening of the relationship with them, so that today a sensible part of audience by surprise has somehow become audience by habit, thanks to a policy devoted both to reach and retain them. This success is foreseen through an intense work of partnership building, which is essential to reach audience by surprise (schools, institutions, associations, etc.), a long and on-going process that requires lot of time, as well as a strong attention to making the whole environment able to welcome everybody. <br/>Since they have a more consolidated and on-going work with groups and schools, the work with individuals - those audiences by choice from Paris area who use to attend theatre shows but usually don’t come to this neighbourhood - is a major challenge. It’s a field they are experimenting on, which is difficult because of the major competition in cultural offer of Paris, and here is where outreach staff work more closely to the communication department. An audience objective related to this is to increase paying visitors: only theatre shows are charged, and most of activities for schools and groups are for free, whilst there are special and different price policies for partners card holders. Although incomes from ticketing and space rentals have grown in the last three years, increasing revenues is one MdM challenges.";"Although the clear mission of MdM, since its establishment, was to involve and engage all kind of audience, with a strong and specific attention to those who are usually far from cultural practice, the organisation had to change over time in order to be more effective in pursuing its mission. Three main leadership and organisational changes happened between 2009 and 2013. <br/>The first big change was in leadership as, after two years opening, two new artistic directors - Philippe Mourrat and Christine Chalas - were appointed by the municipality, also in relation to their artistic project focused on programming contemporary works with a strong attention to audiences.<br/>The new directors changed also the way outreach staff organised the reach and engage of audiences. Since then, three persons were devoted to promote the cultural offer among all kind of audiences, but because it was not about selling tickets rather about building relationships, this distinction didn’t work. Today the same persons are in charge to work each with different and specific segments: one with schools, one with groups, and one with individuals. This allowed the outreach staff to create and feed lasting relationships with different social groups, and led to an increasing of audience and loyalty in all segments.<br/>A part from those changes, what’s specific of MdM (there are just a couple of theatres in France with the same role) is also that they have a work figure specifically devoted to link the artistic programming with AD objectives. The chief of Production (Responsable de Production et Médiation) is also in charge of Mediation and works very close with the Chief of Audiences (Pôle Publics). Although artistic directors choose in total autonomy artists and productions, these are always productions with a strong link to audiences, so the Chief of Production and Mediation works with artists not only to define all production related issues and practicalities, but also to plan and build with them the mediation related activities: meetings, workshops, and whatever can be done with and by the artists to mediate with different kind of audiences are therefore part of negotiation and contracting. This “mediation” side of their artistic job also forms part of the financial negotiation and logistic, and that’s also why they are in charge to the production department.";by choice, by habit, by surprise, community rooted, data, leadership, organisational change, partnership, place
Opgang2;Frederiks Allé 20 B, 8000 Århus C, DENMARK;Independent cultural institution;www.opgang2.dk;Music, Performing Arts;Concerts, Education, Performances, Workshops;"Opgang2 is an independent cultural institution based in Aarhus. The organisation focuses the three core areas: Opgang2 Theatre, Opgang2 Film and Opgang2 Youth Track (Ungdomsspor). Since the beginning in 1974 Opgang2 has grown into becoming one of the most significant professional institutions for youth programs and activities within theatre and film. The three departments work both independently and together, united under the common OPGANG2 logo. <br/>Opgang2 is housed in a former school in the centre of Aarhus. The venue frames all three activities and offers a theatre stage, studios and workshop facilities as well as education rooms for learning programs. The Opgang2 Theatre brings professional theatre to the all parts of Denmark, especially to an unfamiliar theatre audience. The touring theatre performs between 100 and 150 performances each year and all new shows have their premiere at the Aarhus Theatre, the regional main venue for theatre and performing arts. In 2014 the theatre won a Reumert (Best Child and Youth Performance) for the show 4 EVER.";"As an independent cultural institution Opgang2 produce professional theatre productions, documentaries and cultural festivals with and for a young audience – and they engage the youth in a partnership with the artists. The spine of Opgang2 is the use of art and culture as a transforming power to move and create movement. To challenge stereotypes and provoke taboos and in doing so building bridges between people across ethnic, social, cultural and psychological barriers with the overall aim to change people's views of themselves and others. As such the organisation has a clear inclusive and democratic agenda.<br/>On the website Opgang2 defines the ambition to help to create a Denmark that values the individual's unique quality in meaningful communities. This is done through a deliberate artistic and pedagogical method developed over more than 40 years’ practice as a socially engaged initiative. The organization addresses and promotes a deep faith in the ability of the individuals they serve. <br/>The stories presented are taken from the communities in and around Aarhus, picturing the surrounding reality, as seen and felt by the “unruly and disaffected - bruised and confused - edged and chaotic - seeking and courageous young”. The performances circle and provide sharp narratives on essential and uncomfortable social issues as a way to create a strong resonance in the young audience.";"As co-creation and a high degree of participation has been the very core of Opgang2s productions the social engagement in the community from the side of the organization is much about finding ways to ease the participation of the young people that deliver so much and who live in the periphery of the Danish welfare state. The Opgang2 model takes a fundamentally different starting point than Danish society as such, in addressing the young as a resource for the artistic and educational projects and in doing so creating an environment and experiences that reinforce the ability, the will and belief in their own power and their own potential. In a Danish perspective this is a unique position18. <br/>In 2015, 25.000 young saw the theatre’s performances of which roughly 23.000 were from outside Aarhus. As one of very few theatres in Denmark, Opgang2 reaches suburban migrant communities from all parts of the country. This has given them an exclusive position and they are widely regarded as one of the most significant intercultural players in the country. <br/>Throughout the years Opgang2 has positioned itself as a still more important institution high lightening the life circumstances of marginalised young people by giving them an opportunity through art to express and frame their own stories to a young audience. Opgang2 is motivated and established in order to foster change and inclusion of those who are left outside the norm and cultural offerings through a deliberate artistic and pedagogical method, where the young people become co-creators of the productions, all anchored in narratives deriving from the young themselves.";building capacity, by choice, by surprise, co-creation, community rooted, place
People Express;Sharpe’s Pottery Heritage and Arts Centre, Swadlincote, UNITED KINGDOM;Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO);www.people-express.org.uk;Music, Performing Arts;---;"PE is a well-established arts organisation (25 years old in 2015), with complex, farreaching and deep-rooted relationships with the communities in the district where it has grown, and a track record of innovative and high quality participatory and community arts projects that have attracted national and international acclaim. <br/>Originally founded in 1990 as an Unincorporated Association registered charity with a board of voluntary committee members, PE changed into a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO). It is a key member of EMPAF (East Midlands Participatory Art Forum), championing the promotion of the region’s strength in the range, quality and diversity of arts engagement. <br/>PE mission is to enable people to be seen and heard through the arts. PE underlying principles remain:<br/>• Pioneering high quality creative challenges<br/>• Respecting everyone as individual and equal participants<br/>• Developing Individual/Community strengths<br/>• Securing resources and partnerships<br/>• Communicating the results of their work<br/>• Achieving the highest standards of practice";"PE new strategy for AD was born from looking at itself. The organization saw that it was working with the same groups over two, or five or even ten years. This is very good in some ways, it means the interest is deep and meaningful, but it also means one can only work with a small number of people, while there are many people who remain hidden and feel the need to start to drive their own artistic programme and to create new exciting projects and art work. That’s why PE is shifting from working mostly with people who have challenges (targeting excluded groups like disability or poverty) to working with everybody ‘inclusively’ and getting people involved because of where they live, or an interest they share etc. <br/>PE promotes the benefits - to individuals and the wider community - of using creative thinking and expression and a user-led approach to tackling issues of economic regeneration, equality of opportunity, lifelong learning, social inclusion and community and personal development. <br/>PE is committed to reducing our environmental impact and has put in place an action plan to help it make sustainable environmental improvements, which it will be monitoring on a regular basis.";"PE builds relationships for deeper level socially engaged work between artists and participants resulting in well-made, ambitious and original projects producing artwork that moves, inspires and resonates with audiences. <br/>PE develops its work on the basis that in terms of ‘creative ability’ everyone is equal, and the arts are a universal language that should be accessible to all as it fosters tolerance, shared beliefs and community cohesion. It develops creative opportunities and access to arts based on the principles of community participation and self-help. <br/>It provides arts activities at an increased number of public events with large audiences that are set up and run by other people/groups. This has increased the audience and the number of people who do ‘low level’ activity with them.<br/>With its work with older people and people with dementia, PE is planning a much bigger project that goes all over the County. The first project was called Crafty Chatters and was run by the group in supported housing. This new project is called Imprinted - and will be developed with the Alzheimer Society. If funding is secured professional printmakers will be commissioned to work with lots of groups all over the County on some art work that will come together as a finished piece, with a focus on engaging older men, as they are slower and more unlikely to refer their wives for support for dementia.<br/>Their current AD strategy is Something For Nothing (SFN), based on artists commissions mainly in rural areas, health & wellbeing projects and arts and young people projects: the main reason for the new AD strategy is to ‘open out’ what they do to more people and put the artists in the driving seat of the work.";building capacity, by choice, by surprise, community rooted, place
St. Christopher Chamber Orchestra;Stiklių str. 8, LT-01131, Vilnius, LITHUANIA;Public Cultural Institution;www.kristoforas.lt;Music;Concerts, Education, Workshops;"The ensemble took the name of St. Christopher – the patron saint of Vilnius and travellers. Their main concert hall place is St. Catherine Church (Sv. Kotrynos baznycia), that is not only one of the architectural sacred heritage jewels of the capital of Lithuania, but also since several years now, the municipality owned venue for concerts and chamber like cultural events. The orchestra does not own the place, but has a priority in use of it for rehearsals and concerts. It was one of the first churches renovated after Lithuania regained its independence. The place, due to its excellent acoustic features, is used mostly for concerts of different music ensembles, choirs, and orchestras, performing artists based in Vilnius. The place since 2006 is owned by Teachers’ House organization. This is the main orchestra location, but its activity in Vilnius and Lithuania is not reduced to this venue. The ensemble is challenging audience habits through invitation for their concerts to old industrial buildings, meadows in the forests, sand mining pit, balloon landing place, swimming pool, children library, etc.<br/>The orchestra has a high profile reputation among musicians and audience for its stylistic universality, professionalism, artistic imagination, and unusual, open-minded approach to music programs, locations and contexts (like playing music in the balloon or swimming pool). This is a generous and complimentary activity added to the main artistic development as classical musicians. From 1995 the ensemble initiated Christopher Summer Festival, in which the orchestra’s programs featured prominently. Having earned the reputation of a “baroque orchestra” and the reviver of rare scores, musicologists have termed the orchestra “an excellent base for all of Lithuania’s composers’ conceptions”. Today its repertoire boasts over thirty opuses by Lithuanian authors: from early music to works by students from the Lithuanian Academy of Music.";According to the orchestra manager, who is in charge of strategic planning – three things in combination motivate the audiences: the concert as a special event, the uniqueness of the venue and the music itself (the real content). This is the foundation of St. Christopher Chamber Orchestra marketing strategy. Their main goals are: to attract audiences with a broad music repertoire, to achieve recognition and participation of a younger generation of listeners and to increase the diversity of the audiences.;"The main actions into achievement of Orchestra’s goals in past years were:<br/>• to categorize concert programs according to different listeners’ profiles,<br/>• to describe the main groups of listeners (in this case they are ”adventurers”, ”dreamers”, ”traditionalists” and separate category young families),<br/>• to analyse habits of those groups and choose the best content proposals as well as marketing channels,<br/>• to involve Orchestra members into discussions about the audiences to prove that they are playing for the audience.<br/>The orchestra categorized targeted audience in three groups: children, young audiences 20-25 years old, and classical music lovers. The institution adjusts its program every season, according to these categories, and diversifying its promotion channels, to follow these trends. <br/>They are using sales tools, as ticket distribution through an e-platform. With this instrument, they are able to access databases and tools of analysis of the visitors’ habits and preferences. They treat this as a kind of marketing tool. The Orchestra can follow where the people come from, and they are mainly from Vilnius and bigger cities in the country. They also know where people get the information about orchestra events.

Trafó House of Contemporary Arts;41 Liliom Street, Budapest 1094, HUNGARY;Public Institution;www.trafo.hu;Dance, Music, Performing Arts, Visual Arts;Education, Festival, Networking, Performances, Research;Trafó – House of Contemporary Arts was established as a public institution in 1998 in a post-industrial space, after this power station built in the early 20th century was occupied by performing artists during the 1980s. This was the first centre for contemporary arts in Hungary of its kind. The venue offers various spaces (theatre hall, small studio, gallery and a club), varying in capacity from 40 to 300 seats. Unlike other Hungarian theatres that have permanent companies and repertory programs, Trafó collaborates with different companies, goes beyond the dominant performing arts language and experiments with visuals and theatre space. As stated in Trafó's mission, it builds an open-minded venue for showcasing various genres - contemporary theatre, dance, music, new circus and other visual arts, through which it gathers diverse audience. Trafó works seasonally and offers program from September till the end of June. Provision of spaces for many different domestic and international artists complicated promotion for the organization, so Trafó constantly tries to find ways to connect various art forms and practices, as well as attract visitors and build relations with them.;"Due to the nature of contemporary arts, especially conceptual arts, and the fact that this kind of art is not part of Hungarian tradition, Trafó experiences many difficulties in presenting contemporary arts. There is not a problem to attract professionals and artists for contemporary arts but attracting ordinary people presents a challenge to the organization. This issue becomes more complicated in competitive Hungarian context in which many Hungarian theatres offer popular programs. Since politicians, donors and administrators are often uninterested in long-term strategies and differences between Trafó and repertory theatres, they primarily insist on the numbers of sold tickets, performances and visitors, thus push Trafó, and many other organizations in contemporary arts, to develop various strategies to enlarge, diversify or develop interaction with new audiences. <br/>Trafó defines its target audience as intelligentsia, young, urban people, Y generation, people between 20 and 30 years of age, mostly students and women. In order to reach its projected audience, Trafó collaborates with educational institutions (especially universities), organizes workshops and small-scale artists’ lectures about the performance's context, etc. To increase audience by choice, Trafó has used selected variations of marketing approach and branding. For example, a series of performances were initiated on the same topic, with the same style or way of thinking in order to attract people to buy tickets for all the events. Other marketing tactics included price discounts, seasonal tickets, etc.";"Since Trafó has been working in the field of contemporary arts for more than 18 years, the initial regular audience that used to follow Trafó's program has changed – spectators got older, got children, changed habits and interests, have less time and are pressured by financial crises. Gradually, Trafó has started to lose audience. Loss of audience, an insufficient number of visitors and prejudices about contemporary arts being hermetic and incomprehensible, have forced Trafó to transform to more audience-centric organization. So, Trafó tries to advocate contemporary arts as important part of social life. The organization makes an effort to maintain constant dialogue with people, to help them to develop their own opinion and to articulate their thoughts. Therefore, building mutual understanding between institution and audience on the institutional and personal level, and understanding audiences' expectations, interests and reactions have become very important for the whole organization. In order to get more information about its audience, their interests and habits, and follow its tendencies, Trafó conducts research every two years. The research is mostly survey based and the data are analysed by experts who provide recommendations to the organization.<br/>Trafó had changed its strategies over the years. It increased marketing and press department where more and more people started to work in social media, while only 5 years ago the department did not have full time employees. In order to reach and diversify audience, organizational structure was changed and cultural offer increased. During the years Trafó has introduced various kinds of tactics in ticket selling, trying to find a way to motivate audience for subsequent visits (e.g. buying tickets for 2 performances is cheaper than buying just for 1). Trafó also starts to explore the potential of social media in bringing the changes and strengthening follow-up activities.<br/>In order to diversify and attract new audiences, Trafó has developed the educational program in secondary school for teachers and pupils, and also offers a complex and progressive education-package for teenagers interested in contemporary culture. They also developed a community-gathering place, decorated with sofas, chairs and other furniture, to create atmosphere people usually have at home. This represents an attempt to create the venue as a more comfortable place. In this transition towards an audiencecentric organization, the staff stressed that they also need more comfortable café and seats for the spectators.";by choice, by habit, data, digital, partnership, place
